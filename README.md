# Memory-matching-game
The Memory Matching Game is a classic card-flipping puzzle designed to test and improve a playerâ€™s memory, concentration, and focus. The game consists of a grid of face-down cards, each hiding an image, number, symbol, or word. Every card has a matching pair hidden somewhere else in the grid.
